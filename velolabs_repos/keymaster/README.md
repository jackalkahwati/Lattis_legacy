# keymaster

## Structure

- Contains `requirements.txt` for Python dependencies.
- Includes an `application/` directory, `application.py`, and `config/` directory, common in Flask/Django projects.
- A `Procfile` and `.ebextensions/` suggest deployment configurations (e.g., Heroku, AWS Elastic Beanstalk).
- Includes `tests/` for automated tests and `locustfile.py` for load testing.

## Purpose
