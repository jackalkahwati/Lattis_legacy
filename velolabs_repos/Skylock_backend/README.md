# Skylock_backend

This repository appears to host the source code for the main Skylock backend service, likely built with Python.

## Structure

- Contains Python dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
- Includes an `application/` directory, `application.py`, and `config/` directory, suggesting a web framework like Flask or Django.
- A `Procfile` and `.ebextensions/` directory indicate deployment configurations, possibly for platforms like Heroku or AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
- Includes `tests/` directory for automated tests and `locustfile.py` for load testing.

## Purpose

This seems to be the primary backend API or web service powering the Skylock system.
