# lattis-platform

This repository contains a Node.js backend application, likely the core "Lattis Platform".

## Structure

- Contains `package.json` for dependencies and `index.js` as a likely entry point.
- Organized into directories common for backend services: `models/`, `handlers/`, `db/`, `utils/`, `helpers/`, etc.
- Includes `config.js` for configuration settings.

## Purpose

Based on the name and structure, this appears to be the main backend platform or API service for the Lattis system.
