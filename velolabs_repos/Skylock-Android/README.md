# Skylock-Android

This repository contains an Android application project for Skylock, built using Gradle.

## Structure

- Standard Gradle project layout with the main application likely in `app/`.
- Includes build scripts (`build.gradle`, `settings.gradle`, `gradlew`).
- Presence of `library/` and `libs/` directories suggests it might contain or depend on custom libraries.

## Purpose

This appears to be the main Android application for the Skylock product or service.
