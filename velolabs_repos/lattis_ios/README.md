# lattis_ios

This repository contains the source code for the Lattis iOS application, potentially including multiple related app targets or whitelabeled versions.

## Structure

- Contains the main Xcode project (`Lattis.xcodeproj`) and workspace (`Lattis.xcworkspace`).
- Includes numerous subdirectories (e.g., `Lattis/`, `Sandy Pedals/`, `Grin/`, `YRyde/`, `Shared/`, `LattisCore/`) which might represent different modules, targets, or versions of the application.
- Dependencies managed via CocoaPods (`Podfile`) and Ruby gems (`Gemfile`).
- Contains `fastlane/` for automation and `.github/` for GitHub Actions.

## Purpose

This appears to be the primary monorepo for the Lattis iOS application and its various adaptations or whitelabels.
