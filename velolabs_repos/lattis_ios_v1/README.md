# lattis_ios_v1

This repository contains the source code for a version of the Lattis iOS application (potentially v1).

## Structure

- Contains the Xcode project (`Lattis.xcodeproj`) and workspace (`Lattis.xcworkspace`).
- Main application code is likely in the `Lattis/` directory, with shared code in `Shared/`.
- Includes a `Today/` directory (possibly for a Today Extension) and `Locations/`.
- Dependencies managed via CocoaPods (`Podfile`) and potentially Ruby gems (`Gemfile`).
- Includes a `fastlane/` directory for automation.

## Purpose

This appears to be the primary iOS application for the Lattis product or service (labeled v1).
